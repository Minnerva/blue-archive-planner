# What's this for
For planning **Blue Archive** pull based from the JP foresight of 6 months. 
This helps predict if you will be able to have enough spark or pulls at the begining of the banner date.

# Disclaimer
I do recommended to use **Pyroxene Planner** from the Official Discord Community as this application based the amount of pyrox gain from 2 months = 1 spark.

Banner list will take sometimes to update to the latest as I have to update it manually.
